Garmin Connect IQ Game Space Trek

Boldly go where no watch has gone before!  For free!

In Space Trek, you're the captain of a starship tasked with destroying all enemies in your quadrant.  But you have a limited amount of time, energy, and weapons.  Can you rise to the challenge?

You start out in a random sector of your quadrant, with stars, enemies, and bases displayed on the main grid.  You can freely move around the current sector using impulse engines, but traveling to a different sector uses the warp drive and takes time off your clock.  So plan your movements carefully!

You have phasers and 10 torpedoes to attack with.  Torpedoes are more powerful, but they can stray off course and miss the target, especially over long distances.  Phaser damage decreases over longer distances, but they always fire straight towards the target.  Both weapons require line of sight and may hit something other than what you're aiming at.

Enemies fire disruptors, which work just like phasers, and they can only shoot once.  But all enemies in a sector will attack you at the same time.  Your shields will absorb most of the attack, but if they go down, you'll take significant damage to your torpedoes, phasers, or warp core.  Damaged torpedoes are more likely to fly off course, damaged phasers do less damage, and damaged warp drives require more time to travel between sectors.  Each system can completely break, requiring repairs before they can be used at all.

Everything is tap and confirm, meaning when you tap something, you'll get buttons asking you to either refine your choice or confirm your actions.  Tap around the big grid to take actions in your sector, or tap the small grid to bring up the quadrant to warp to other sectors.  Tap the energy bar to adjust shields, or tap the damage report to perform repairs.  Fly next to a base and tap it to dock.  Be careful not to fly through things, though, or you'll take damage!

Do you have what it takes to defeat the enemy?  Good luck, captain!  Live long and prosper.

I'm still trying to balance out the game to make it more challenging while still being fun, so I'd love any feedback or suggestions.  I made this game for fun and share it freely.
